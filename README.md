In this project, you will be working with two training tables that contain Twitch users’ stream (video) viewing data and chat room usage data.

Stream viewing data:
-   stream table

Chat usage data:

Twitch Part 2: Visualize Data with Matplotlib

In part 2 of this the project, you will be taking your findings from the SQL queries and visualize them using Python and Matplotlib, in the forms of:

-   Bar Graph: Featured Games
